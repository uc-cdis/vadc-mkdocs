# vadc-mkdocs
(under dev) VADC documentation in MkDocs format

This repo is for the [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) version of the VADC documentation. This is NOT currently live. The live VADC documentation repo is [https://github.com/uc-cdis/va-doc](https://github.com/uc-cdis/va-doc)

This repo will be able to provide the framework for using markdown-formatted documents and a mkdocs.yaml to create HTML using MkDocs Material. 

The reason for eventually converting the existing documentation to MkDocs is because it will be MUCH easier to maintain and update, and User Services is trying to get project documentation a bit more standardized (in terms of how it's maintained) where possible. HEAL and BRH already use MkDocs Material, and we are converting the Gen3 documentation to either MkDocs or Docusaurus. Since VADC is a pretty dynamic project that has needed a lot of documentation updates in the past year (and that isn't expected to end soon), we wanted to make the update process easier. It also will produce documentation that has more aesthetic flexibility, and will provide a lot more built-in navigation for a better user experience.
