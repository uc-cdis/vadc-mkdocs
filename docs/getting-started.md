# **Getting Started**

## **Login Page**

Users will log in with their VA PIV credentials. Start by visiting the [login page](https://va.data-commons.org/login) and sign in with your organizational account. After successfully logging in, your username will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Click this link for more information about using the [PIV login](https://www.oit.va.gov/resources/remote-access/cag/windows/index.cfm?#piv).  

Once logged in, the user will see there are several options in the upper right hand corner of the [home screen](https://va.data-commons.org/). In the blue bar at the top of the page, there is a link to VA Data Commons Documentation (*the page you are currently reading*), Email Support, your username, and a log out button. Below these options, there are tabs for the Workspace, Apps, and Profile pages.
